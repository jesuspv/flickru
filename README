Command-line tool 'flickru' automatises photos/videos uploads to Flickr.

Entering 'flickru <directory>' in your command line, any photos under 'directory' (and subdirs)
are uploaded to your Flickr account (interactively entered at the first time you start flickru).

Photos are identified by case-insensitive extensions: GIF, JPEG, JPG, and PNG.
Videos are identified by case-insensitive extensions: AVI, MPEG, and MPG.

The following Flickr metadata for photos (as well as videos) is set:
 - date-taken from the file (last) modification time
 - private, visible by friends & family, hidden for public searches
 - safety level to safe
 - permission for friends & family to add comments to the photo and it's notes
 - permission for nobody to add notes and tags to the photo
 - for videos larger than the Flickr's longer than 90s (but shorter than 500MB,
   Flickr's maximum permisible size), the description will contain an annotation
   about its large duration.
 - title, geolocation, and accuracy from the owner directory's name.
Owner directory name format is given by the format 'TITLE[@LOCATION[#PRECISION]]',
where:
 - TITLE is the desired title for the photos directly stored in the directory
 - LOCATION is the location of the stored photos specified as either:
   - the Wikipedia page name (whitespaces allowed) of the location (if exists) or
   - its coordinates LATITUDE,LONGITUDE
 - PRECISION is the Flickr geolocation precision given by one of the following
   case insentitive literals: street, city, region, country, world.

Photos are classified into a photoset (existing or not) entitled with the
second-level directory name containing the photo. The photoset is arranged by
date taken (older first).
