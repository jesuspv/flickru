Command-line tool 'flickru' automatises photo/video uploads to Flickr.

Entering 'flickru <directory>' in your command line, any photos under 'directory' (and subdirs)
are uploaded to your Flickr account (interactively entered at the first time you start flickru).

Photos are identified by case-insensitive extensions: GIF, JPEG, JPG, and PNG.
Videos are identified by case-insensitive extensions: AVI, MPEG, and MPG.

The following Flickr metadata for photos (as well as videos) is set:
 (1) date-taken from the file (last) modification time
 (2) private, visible by friends & family, hidden for public searches
 (3) safety level to safe
 (4) permission for friends & family to add comments to the photo and it's notes
 (5) permission for nobody to add notes and tags to the photo
 (6) for videos larger than the Flickr's longer than 90s (but shorter than 500MB,
     Flickr's maximum permisible size), the description will contain an annotation
     about its large duration.
 (7) title, geolocation, and accuracy from the owner directory's name.

Owner directory name format is given by the format 'TITLE[@LOCATION[#PRECISION]]',
where:
 (1) TITLE is the desired title for the photos directly stored in the directory
 (2) LOCATION is the location of the stored photos specified as either:
   (a) the Wikipedia page name (whitespaces allowed) of the location (if exists) or
   (b) its coordinates LATITUDE,LONGITUDE
 (3) PRECISION is the Flickr geolocation precision given by one of the following
     case insentitive literals: street, city, region, country, world.

Photos are classified into a photoset (existing or not) entitled with the
second-level directory name containing the photo. The photoset is arranged by
date taken (older first).
